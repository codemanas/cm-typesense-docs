Overriding the template allows you to change things of the output for your autocomplete or instant search design as you need to.

- Plugin base folder: `search-with-typesense/templates`

The templates are in the plugin `search-with-typesense/templates` and you can override it by copying it to your child theme.

To override, copy files from `wp-content/plugins/search-with-typesense/templates/` folder to `wp-content/themes/your-theme/search-with-typesense/`,

Then you can make the changes as you need.
Copy the file `main-panel.php` from `wp-content/plugins/search-with-typesense/templates/instant-search/main-panel.php` to `wp-content/themes/your-theme/search-with-typesense/instant-search/main-panel.php`.
