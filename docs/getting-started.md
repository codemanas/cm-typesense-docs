# Getting Started

## Generate API Keys
Before you do anything else, you must first add the API keys and configure the node.

If you are hosting Typesense locally / on your own server.
Then please see the steps here to generate API Keys

Otherwise, if you have gone with Typesense cloud option - then once the cluster is set up. There will be an option to generate your API keys.

Here you can 

1. Enable which post types should be indexed
2. Bulk index the selected post types
3. Replace WordPress Search to show autocomplete or instant search popup

### Enable Post Types
This option allows you to select which post types to index.
By default the plugin allows you to index posts and pages.
Pro version of the plugin will be needed to index custom post types.

### Bulk Index
Bulk Index option allows you to index all posts(post types) at once.
Indexing means they will add the document into Typesense instant to be easily retrieved.

### Replace WordPress Search
When this option is enabled it will replace all search forms that use
default WordPress search with either Instant Search popup or autocomplete.
Developer Note: It will replace all calls for get_search_form() and the default WordPress search widget or "core/search" block used

#### Instant Search Popup
Instant Search - replaces all instance of default WordPress search - search forms etc with a popup of instant search.
You can customize the appearance of the search by going to appearance > customize > Typesense Search

To add a custom trigger - you can add the class "cm-swt-instant-search-popup--trigger" to your button / svg / anchor tag to trigger the popup
Something like the following:
```
<a href="#" class="cm-swt-instant-search-popup--trigger cm-swt-instant-search-popup--trigger-default"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
  <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 21l-6-6m2-5a7 7 0 11-14 0 7 7 0 0114 0z" />
</svg></a>
```
