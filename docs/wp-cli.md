## WP CLI

WP-CLI serves as the command-line interface for WordPress, offering a range of commands for various actions typically executed in the WordPress admin.

Within the framework of the Search With Typesense plugin, our plugin introduces its own set of WP-CLI commands. These commands enable you to index and delete post types, with the flexibility to specify particular IDs. Additionally, the plugin provides an option to assess the health status of the Typesense server.

This is very helpful if you have command line access to your WordPress installation instace on your server.

**Kindly be aware that the subsequent commands will not remove your posts from the WordPress database. Instead, these commands exclusively index or delete the posts on your Typesense Server.**

**Note**: *We intend to incorporate additional commands in the future based on your requests. Your feedback would be highly valuable.*
